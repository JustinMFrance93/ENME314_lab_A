ENME314 LAB A: Flow rate measurement 
Author: Justin France

The purpose of this lab is to learn about flow rate measurement using a venturi, an orifice plate, a 
rotameter, and an electronic flow meter. You will also explore the pressure drop across a 90 degree bend in 
the pipe. You will practice reading piezometers. You will apply the advice above about taking 
measurements, estimating uncertainty and accuracy, plotting data and reporting results with 
uncertainties. 

 Python t was used to procese  the lab results where following values was caculated:piozometer head differences, 
Reynolds numbers and flow rates through the venturi and orifice plate. A plot comparing the caculated flow rates throught the orifce plate
and  ventruir was then conpaired to the electrionic flow meter readings.
